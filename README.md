Course final project source code/files for COMP Sci 349 (Machine Learning) Final, Spring 2021


Note: A list of Reddit posts/URLs was obtained using a command-line tool built ontop of the Python Reddit API by myself [located here](https://github.com/njk639/RedditLinkScraper)

Documentation is currently weak as much of this work was compiled rather hastily.

Training and Testing datasets can be found in the TestProcessed.csv and TrainProcessed.csv and were generated using the code in the respectively named Jupyter Notebooks (ProcessingTestData.ipynb, andd ProcessingTrainData.ipynb). Intermediate data has not been uploaded to avoid inflating the size of this repository more than necessary.

Exploratory data analysis and classification (hwk sections 4/5) can be found in EDA_SVC_Models.ipynb, while section 6's KMeans/GMM can be found in UnsupervisedClustering.ipynb.
