# COMP_SCI_349_MachineLearning_Final
Course final project source code/files for COMP Sci 349 (Machine Learning) Final, Spring 2021

Note: A list of Reddit posts/URLs was obtained using a command-line tool built ontop of the Python Reddit API by myself [located here](https://github.com/njk639/praw-codials), some processing of the specific web URLs collected via Reddit is provided by functions contained in dnd_scraper_tools.py.

Documentation is currently weak as much of this work was compiled rather hastily.

Training and Testing datasets can be found in the TestProcessed.csv and TrainProcessed.csv and were generated using the code in the respectively named Jupyter Notebooks (ProcessingTestData.ipynb, andd ProcessingTrainData.ipynb). Intermediate data has not been uploaded to avoid inflating the size of this repository more than necessary.

Exploratory data analysis and classification (hwk sections 4/5) can be found in EDA_SVC_Models.ipynb, while section 6's KMeans/GMM can be found in UnsupervisedClustering.ipynb.

# This repository/its Jupyter Notebooks are currently broken due to data issues. I'll be uploading an updated version of this shortly.
