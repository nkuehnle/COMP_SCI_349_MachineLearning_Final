    "We can see we have some different varieties of potentially useful links, including /share/ and /edit/ links. There are also some from unrelated domains (Google Docs, Wikipedia articles, etc.) and some direct links to PDF files that lack the HTML source we want to collect.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have three varieties of link text:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Raw links\n",
    "URLs with no special formating around them.\n",
    "> <pre>Gmbinder Link: https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MW5xKc1QPj4TXEgBzQm</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown links\n",
    "These take the form of a display text portion in brackets immediately followed by a URL in parenthesis.\n",
    "> <pre>[Display text](url)</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, in some cases, the display text is also a url and in at least one case early on the url is incorrect in the display text portion, but correct in the actual url segment of the link code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <pre>[https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/MhTK9\\_7zHuB6](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/MhTK9_7zHuB6)</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, the url portion is more likely to be correct in most cases, we'll go exclusively with raw links and the (url) portion of markdown code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we can use a set of regular expressions. After a few trial and errors, I arrived at the following:\n",
